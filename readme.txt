## Reviews Page ##

On this page you can view the reviews retrieved by the plugin.  Please note that the Google Places API only allows for 5 reviews
to be retrieved at a time.  We will continue to check via the API every day or so and using a data base store the reviews for you
so over time you can have more than 5 reviews.   You can "promote" certain reviews by making these the reviews you show if you
have more than the number of reviews to be displayed.

## WordPress Widget and Shortcode##

Display Google Places reviews on your WordPress site using our widget or shortcode.  The following settings are supported:

* Widget Title:  Add Widget Title (Optional)
* Place Lookup:  Start typing your Business Name and select it when it auto completes.
* Lookup Type:  Having trouble finding the correct business? Try narrowing down the results by having the Place Lookup search only by business name - "Establishments", by address - "Addresses", or by area - "Regions".
* Place Name:  Once the correct business is selected from "Places Lookup" this will auto fill.
* Place ID: Once the correct business is selected from "Places Lookup" this will auto fill.
* Show Reviews Only: By default the plugin will display your business data.  If checked the widget will not show your business data.
* Maximum Excerpt Length:  Chose the length of excerpts that will look best for your site.
* Show # Reviews:  Pick the number of reviews to show.
* Total # of Reviews:  Enter the number of reviews that you have on your google places page.  The Google API does not allow us to get this info for you, so you have to manually add it for your review schema output.
* Minimum Review Rating:  If you only want to show 4 star or 5 Star reviews you can select the appropriate setting.

When using a shortcode, use the Place Lookup field on the Settings page to look up the Place ID for your business.
